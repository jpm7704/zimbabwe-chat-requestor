# Redundant and Incorrectly Placed Pages Analysis

## Navigation Issues

1. **Role Management Page**:
   - Currently accessible via main navigation for any user with `canManageUsers` permission
   - Should be limited to only admin and director roles, not all management roles

2. **System Settings Page**:
   - Currently visible in navigation for all users with `canAccessSystemSettings`
   - Redundant with regular settings page for non-admin users
   - Should be consolidated or more clearly differentiated

## Permission Inconsistencies

3. **Field Work Pages**:
   - Both field officers and project officers see the same field work interface
   - Should have role-specific views with different capabilities (assignment vs. execution)
   - Creates functional redundancy between roles

4. **Reports Access**:
   - Current permissions allow multiple roles to access reports but don't differentiate what they can see
   - Programme managers, field officers and directors all see the same reports view
   - Should implement role-specific filters and views

5. **Analytics Page**:
   - Currently accessible by various management roles but shows the same data
   - Should provide role-appropriate analytics views (e.g., project-level for project officers, organization-wide for directors)

## Routing Issues

6. **User Profile Page**:
   - Current implementation shows the same fields for all users regardless of role
   - Should adapt based on user role and permissions

7. **Approvals Page**:
   - Currently designed for multiple approval roles (director, CEO, patron)
   - Contains redundant functionality that should be streamlined for each role
   - Should have role-specific approval workflows

## Permission Logic Gaps

8. **RequirePermission Component**:
   - Current implementation has special cases for field officers and admin
   - Creates inconsistency in how permissions are checked across the application
   - Should implement a more consistent permissions framework

9. **Dashboard Redundancy**:
   - The Dashboard currently shows different cards based on user role
   - Some cards lead to pages that the user can't fully utilize
   - Should be more tailored to specific role capabilities

10. **Dev Mode Bypass**:
    - Current implementation allows bypassing all permission checks in development mode
    - Creates inconsistent testing environment and potential security issues
    - Should maintain consistent permission checks even in development

## Recommendations

1. Implement role-based routing that clearly defines which pages each role can access
2. Create role-specific views for shared pages rather than showing the same interface
3. Consolidate redundant functionality between similar roles
4. Implement a more consistent permission checking system
5. Clearly differentiate between admin-only and general management pages
